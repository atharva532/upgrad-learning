# Checklists

Quality gates to verify work at different stages.

## Available Checklists

| Checklist | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| `feature-complete.md` | Before marking a feature as done |
| `pre-commit.md` | Before committing code |
| `security-review.md` | For security-sensitive changes |
| `validation.md` | Master validation for AI-generated code |

## Usage

Run through the relevant checklist:
- ✅ Mark items as complete
- ❌ Fix any failing items before proceeding

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `validation.md` checklist includes AI-specific checks for hallucinated imports and should be used for all AI-assisted code generation.
